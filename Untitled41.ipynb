By repeatedly improving errors and combining all models,boosting increases overall accuracy and performance.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JoOPm13Zh2HE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.What is the difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting in terms of how models are trained?**\n","\n","**Ans:** The main difference lies in their training approach:\n","\n","* AdaBoost:It increases the weight of incorrectly predicted data points so that the next model focuses more on those difficult cases.Final predictions are made using weighted voting of all models.\n","* Gradient Boosting:It trains each new model to reduce the error(residuals) of the previous model using gradient descent.It optimizes a loss function step by step.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HwfVTohDjtLx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q3.How does regularization help in XGBoost?**\n","\n","**Ans:** Regularization in XGBoost helps to prevent overfitting by controlling the complexity of the model.It adds penalties for large coefficients and overly omplex trees,which improves generalization on new data.This makes the model more stable,accurate,and likely to memorize the training data."],"metadata":{"id":"eUMcC3lxnQat"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q4.Why is CatBoost considered efficient for handling categorical data?**\n","\n","**Ans:** CatBoost is efficient for handling categorical data because it can process categorical features directly without needing extensive preprocessing like one-hot encoding.It uses special encoding techniques and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.this makes it faster and more effective for datasets with many categorical variables."],"metadata":{"id":"p633f-pFocYn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q5.What are soem real-world applications where boosting techniques are preferred over bagging methods?**\n","\n","**Ans:** Boosting techniques are preferred in applications where high accuracy and handling complex patterns are important.Some real-world examples include:\n","\n","*  Fraud detection in banking and finance\n","*  Customer churn prediction in telecom\n","\n","*  Credit scoring and risk analysis\n","*  Medical diagnosis and disease prediction\n","\n","*  Recommendation systems and marketing analysis\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aQCGApIIpb3W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q6.
